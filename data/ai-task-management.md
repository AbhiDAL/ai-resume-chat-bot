# AI-Powered Task Management System

## Project Overview
Developed an intelligent task management application that uses machine learning to prioritize tasks, suggest optimal scheduling, and provide productivity insights. Built with Next.js, Python FastAPI, and OpenAI GPT-4.

## Timeline
**Duration:** 8 months (January 2023 - August 2023)
**Team Size:** 3 developers (1 fullstack, 1 ML engineer, 1 backend)
**Role:** Full-Stack Lead Developer

## Technical Architecture

- Custom priority scoring algorithm using task metadata
- Sentiment analysis for stress level detection in task descriptions
- Predictive modeling for task completion time estimation

## Core Features

### Intelligent Task Prioritization
- **Smart Scoring:** ML algorithm considers deadlines, dependencies, and user patterns
- **Context Awareness:** Analyzes task descriptions to understand complexity and urgency
- **Dynamic Reordering:** Automatically adjusts priorities as conditions change
- **Custom Rules:** Users can define personal prioritization criteria

### Natural Language Processing
- **Smart Task Creation:** "Schedule dentist appointment next week" â†’ fully structured task
- **Bulk Import:** Process email content to automatically extract action items
- **Meeting Integration:** Parse calendar events to create related tasks
- **Voice Commands:** Speech-to-text integration for hands-free task management

### Productivity Analytics
- **Performance Tracking:** Time-to-completion analysis with trend visualization
- **Bottleneck Detection:** Identifies workflow inefficiencies and suggests improvements
- **Habit Recognition:** Learns user patterns to optimize scheduling recommendations
- **Stress Monitoring:** Analyzes task language to detect overwhelm and suggest breaks

## Technical Implementations

### Machine Learning Pipeline
```python
# Task Priority Scoring Algorithm
def calculate_priority_score(task):
    base_score = urgency_weight * urgency_factor
    deadline_score = deadline_weight * days_until_deadline
    dependency_score = dependency_weight * blocking_tasks_count
    user_pattern_score = pattern_weight * historical_preference
    
    return normalize_score(base_score + deadline_score + 
                          dependency_score + user_pattern_score)
```

### Real-Time Synchronization
- WebSocket connections for instant updates across devices
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback capabilities
