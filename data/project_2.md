# Project: Sentinel Vision

## Overview
Sentinel Vision is a real-time computer vision system for industrial safety monitoring.  
It uses edge-based AI cameras to detect hazards, predict potential machine failures, and alert supervisors instantly through a web dashboard.

## Role
- **Position:** Backend and ML Engineer  
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Built a Python-based inference engine using TensorFlow and OpenCV to detect unsafe conditions.
  - Deployed models to edge devices running NVIDIA Jetson boards.
  - Created a React-based dashboard displaying alerts and system analytics in real time.
  - Integrated MQTT protocol for low-latency data transmission between devices and servers.

## Results
- Achieved 94% accuracy in hazard detection across 12 industrial environments.
- Reduced average alert delay from 4.2 seconds to 0.8 seconds.
- Helped clients cut machine downtime by 18% in pilot tests.

## Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Node.js, React, Docker, MQTT, NVIDIA Jetson.
